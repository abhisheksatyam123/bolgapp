Certainly, I can help you with that. Here's how you can view users, databases, and related information in MySQL:

1. First, log in to MySQL as root:
   ```
   sudo mysql -u root -p
   ```

2. To see all users:
   ```sql
   SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
   ```

3. To see all databases:
   ```sql
   SHOW DATABASES;
   ```

4. To see which user has access to which database:
   ```sql
   SELECT user, host, db FROM mysql.db;
   ```

5. To see detailed privileges for a specific user:
   ```sql
   SHOW GRANTS FOR 'username'@'localhost';
   ```

6. To see all tables in a specific database:
   ```sql
   USE database_name;
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```

7. To see the structure of a specific table:
   ```sql
   DESCRIBE table_name;
   ```

8. To see the creation statement of a table:
   ```sql
   SHOW CREATE TABLE table_name;
   ```

9. To see all active processes:
   ```sql
   SHOW PROCESSLIST;
   ```

10. To see MySQL server status:
    ```sql
    SHOW STATUS;
    ```

11. To see MySQL server variables:
    ```sql
    SHOW VARIABLES;
    ```

    To switch users in MySQL, you have a few options depending on your current situation. Here's how you can do it:

1. If you're outside MySQL:

   You can log out and log back in as a different user:

   ```
   mysql -u new_username -p
   ```
   
   You'll be prompted to enter the password for new_username.

2. If you're already logged into MySQL:

   You can use the `system` command to execute a shell command without leaving the MySQL prompt:

   ```sql
   system mysql -u new_username -p
   ```

   This will prompt you for the new user's password and open a new MySQL session.

3. Using the `USE` statement with a different user:

   If you have the necessary privileges, you can switch to a different user's default database:

   ```sql
   USE new_username;
   ```

   Note that this doesn't actually change your user account, just the active database.

4. Using `sudo` (if you're switching to root):

   If you're switching to the root user and have sudo privileges:

   ```
   sudo mysql
   ```

   This logs you in as the root MySQL user without needing to know the MySQL root password.

Remember, you need appropriate permissions to switch to another user or access their databases. If you encounter a "Access denied" error, it means you don't have the necessary privileges.
